GitHub Gist Quick Link Embed
==============================

----------

**Version 1.0.0**

This plugin creates a WP embed handler for GitHub Gist embeds using the wp embed register handler function. Embedded gists are generated automatically in posts when the link to the gist is pasted into the WP editor. You can get the link to the gist on the leftside bar under "" on GitHub or by clicking the Permalink button on the top right of each gist's code section. Either format is valid (ex: https://gist.github.com/mitchmccline/7876861 or https://gist.github.com/mitchmccline/7876861#file-scss-codekit-wordpress-theme-development-helper).

How to Install
--------------
* Unzip the downloaded Zip File
* Upload the **github-gist-quick-link-embed** directory from this repo to your WordPress plugins directory. EX: /wp-content/plugins/
* Activate the plugin in the Admin Panel
* Start pasting the url for your favorite gists from GitHub into your WordPress posts.
